Crawlers that currently exist are hardly accessible and require professional coding, making it difficult for non-major to use. In addition, the existing crawler program has the disadvantage that it is difficult to grasp at once because the UI is not intuitive.
Therefore, we want to improve UI and UX so that users who have nothing to do
with coding can easily use crawling programs.
