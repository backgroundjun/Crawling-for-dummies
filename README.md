## Problem Statement

   Crawlers that currently exist are hardly accessible and require professional coding, making it difficult for non-major to use.  
   In addition, the existing crawler program has the disadvantage that it is difficult to grasp at once because the UI is not intuitive. Therefore, we want to improve UI and UX so that users who have nothing to do with coding can easily use crawling programs.


## Mission Statement

  - Crawling-for-dummies develops open-source software for web crawling service.

  - Crawling-for-dummies is a chrome-addons that allows user-friendly approach to web crawling. 

  - It is design to easy-to-use software that can be used with little knowledge.
Features List:

  - Ability to extract a specific elements using the element inspection tool

  - Ability to select a selector when a mouse click event occurs on an element

  - Ability to select the desired elements from the entire DOM with a javascript selector (href, innertext, etc.)

  - Ability to list selected elements and extract them as excel, json, csv file.

## What is web crawling?
Web crawling is the process of indexing information on a website using automated scripts or programs. These programs are called by various names, including Web crawlers, Spider, Spider-bot, and Crawlers.


## Why web crawling is IMPORTANT?
In 2013, IBM announced that approximately 90% of the world’s data was generated in the last two years and that the rate of data generation doubled every two years. However, most data is unstructured and Web crawlers index vast amounts of unstructured data to help search engines find the information they want to find.


## In our project…
Crawlers that currently exist are hardly accessible and require professional coding, making it difficult for non-major to use. In addition, the existing crawler program has the disadvantage that it is difficult to grasp at once because the UI is not intuitive. Therefore, we want to improve UI and UX so that users who have nothing to do with coding can easily use crawling programs.


Indexed data also plays an important role in various fields - data science projects.
